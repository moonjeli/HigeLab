function TotalDilution=CalcTotalDilution(firstdilution,seconddilution)
% Report total dilution.
%
% firstDilution - Either a scalar (0 to 1) defining the value for the first 
%                dilution. e.g. 0.1 means 1/10 dilution. Or a vector of
%                length 2, defining flow through the carrier and odour
%                streams. e.g. [0.9,0.3] means 0.9 ml/min carrier and 0.3
%                ml/min odour. 
%
% second dilution - Defines the flow rate (in ml/min) which will be added 
%                to the odour flow.
